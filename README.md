# My Movie Suggestion App

This is a simple Movie Suggestion mobile application which I made using Flutter.
It fetches data from the TMDB API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api). My goal in creating this application is to learn how to fetch data over an API.

## How to download the APK?

You can install this application by downloading the APK inside the Movie-Suggestion-App/build/app/outputs/apk/ folder.
You can do so by pasting this link on your browser:
